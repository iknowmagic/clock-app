# Clock App Development Guidelines

This document provides guidance for GitHub Copilot when generating code for the Clock App project.

## Project Structure

Clock App uses component generation via Plop, following this structure:

```
src/
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   └── ComponentName/
│       ├── index.ts                 # Default export
│       ├── ComponentName.tsx        # Component implementation
│       ├── ComponentName.types.ts   # TypeScript types
│       ├── ComponentName.test.tsx   # Vitest tests
│       └── ComponentName.stories.tsx # Storybook stories
```

## Technology Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with **DaisyUI v5** for styling
- **Vite** as the build tool
- **Vitest** (not Jest) for testing with Testing Library
- **Framer Motion** for animations (particularly for day/night transitions)
- **Zustand** for state management (time, location, theme states)
- **React Icons** for iconography
- **Axios** for API requests to geolocation/time services

## Development Guidelines

### Component Development

- Follow the component structure generated by Plop
- Start with minimal implementation and add complexity as needed
- Include `data-testid` attributes for testing
- Use proper TypeScript types for time and location data

### Styling Approach

- Use Tailwind v4 and DaisyUI v5 classes for styling
- Mobile-first: Design for small screens first, then add responsive classes
- Implement day/night theme variations using Tailwind classes
- Follow consistent spacing patterns for time display components

### Clock App-Specific Components

- **TimeDisplay**: Shows current hour and minutes
- **GreetingMessage**: Updates based on time of day
- **LocationInfo**: Displays city and country
- **ExpandableDetails**: Shows additional time information
- **DayNightToggle**: Controls theme state with transitions

### Animations

Add Framer Motion animations for:

- Day/night background transitions
- Expandable details panel entrance/exit
- Time display updates
- Greeting message changes

### Testing

- Use Vitest for testing
- Mock time-based functions for predictable testing
- Test both rendering and time calculation functionality
- Verify day/night theme transitions

### State Management

- Use Zustand for global state (current time, location, expanded state)
- Keep component state local when possible

### API Integration

- Handle geolocation API errors gracefully
- Implement loading states for time/location data
- Cache location data when appropriate
